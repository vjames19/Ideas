Already Exists in as part of different apps - Antonio Tapia 
2. RolePlay - A android game that is played in the real world you and your friends start the application and connect to a loby where each player receives a role and a scenerio is given to all they players must act out their action as they receive instructions. (i.e. players receive a murder mistery where one of the player is the assasin, the assasin is given orders to separe one of the players so he may officially kill him other players are given other scenarios to act out, or hints in case of the victim) Work even greater with social integration, the application itself would market itself through facebook.

1. Social Integrator - A "smart" application that optimizes the ways that people utilize social media, It is an interface for your social media. It is best suited as a desktop application because it can be better optimized than a web application. this applications will try to learn from user habbits and in a smart way allow block unwanted distractions(time wasters) coming from social media .
